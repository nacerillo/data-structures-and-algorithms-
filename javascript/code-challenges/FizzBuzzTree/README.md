# Challenge Summary

- Fizz Buzz Tree

## Challenge Description

- Take in a tree, and return a tree of similar structure, expect replace all numbers divisible by 5, 3, or BOTH 5 and 3 with "Fizz", "Buzz", and "FizzBuzz", respectively

## Approach & Efficiency:

- created the following classes:

## Tests:

- If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
- If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
- If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
- If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.
